# Unified Policy Engine

## Building & running

    go build
    ./unified-policy-engine

## Use as a library

This section describes each of the main components of the `unified-policy-engine`
library. See the [`run` command](cmd/run.go) for an end-to-end example that uses the
components together.

### Parsing IaC configurations

#### `ConfigurationLoader`

The `ConfigurationLoader` concept from the `loader` package is the main entrypoint to
parsing IaC configurations into the format expected by UPE's rule evaluation code.

##### `LocalConfigurationLoader`

Currently, there is only one implementation of `ConfigurationLoader`, called
`LocalConfigurationLoader`, and it is used to parse IaC configurations from disk:

#### `LoadedConfigurations`

The `LoadedConfigurations` type is the output of a `ConfigurationLoader`. It contains
methods to introspect the loaded configurations and transform them into the UPE input
format.

#### Example

```go
package main

import "github.com/snyk/unified-policy-engine/pkg/loader"

func main() {
  // Initialize the loader
  configLoader := loader.LocalConfigurationLoader(loader.LoadPathsOptions{
    // Paths is a []string that contains paths where the loader should search for IaC
    // configurations
    Paths:       args,
    // InputTypes sets which input types the loader should attempt to parse. The
    // loader.Auto input type includes all known IaC formats.
    InputTypes:  []loader.InputType{inputType},
    // By default, this loader will respect .gitignore files that it finds. This loader
    // searches upwards through parent directories until it finds a .git directory. If
    // a .git directory is found, it will then search for .gitignore files in any
    // directories that are both within the repository and contained within the input
    // paths specified above.
    // Setting this option to true will disable that behavior.
    NoGitIgnore: false,
  })

  // Invoke the loader, returning a LoadedConfigurations struct
  loadedConfigs, err := configLoader()
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // Transform the loaded configurations into a slice of State structs
  states := loadedConfigs.ToStates()
  // ...
}
```

### Evaluating rules

#### `upe.Engine`

The `Engine` type is responsible for evaluating some `State`s with a given set of rules.

#### `data.Provider`

The `data.Provider` type is a function that provides parsed OPA modules and data
documents to some consumer. The `data` package includes a few `Provider` implementations.

##### `data.FSProvider()`

`data.FSProvider()` produces a provider function for the given filesystem. This is
useful for rules that are embedded via the `go:embed` directive:

```go
package main

import (
  "embed"

  "github.com/snyk/unified-policy-engine/pkg/data"
)

//go:embed rules
var rulesFS embed.FS

// The second argument here is the name of the directory where the provider should
// search for rules and data documents.
var rulesProvider = data.FSProvider(rulesFS, "rules")

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

##### `data.LocalProvider()`

`data.LocalProvider()` produces a provider function over some local path. That path
could point to either a file or directory.

```go
package main

import "github.com/snyk/unified-policy-engine/pkg/data"

func main() {
  // ...
  providers := make([]data.Provider, len(paths))
  for idx, path := range paths {
    providers[idx] = data.LocalProvider(path)
  }
}
```

#### Example

```go
package main

import "github.com/snyk/unified-policy-engine/pkg/upe"

func main() {
  ctx := context.Background()
  // ...
  engine, err := upe.NewEngine(ctx, &upe.EngineOptions{
    // Providers contains functions that produce parsed OPA modules or data documents.
    // See above for descriptions of the providers included in this library.
    Providers: providers,
    // This option is used to determine which rules are executed. When this option is
    // empty or unspecified, all rules will be run.
    RuleIDs:   selectedRules,
    // This is an optional instance of the logger.Logger interface. This interface is
    // compatible with the one provided by the snyk/go-common library. The logger
    // package also contains an implementation of this interface.
    Logger:    logger,
    // This is an optional instance of the metrics.Metrics interface. This interface is
    // compatible with the one provided by the snyk/go-common library. The metrics
    // package also contains an implementation of this interface.
    Metrics:   m,
  })
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
  // This function returns a *models.Results
  results, err := engine.Eval(ctx, &upe.EvalOptions{
    // Inputs is a []models.State, like the output of the loadedConfigs.ToStates()
    // described above.
    Inputs: states,
  })
  if err != nil {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Rule Syntax Tutorial

We will walk through the rules in the examples directory, starting out with
simple rules and gradually adding concepts.

### Examples

#### Simple rules part 1

[examples/01-simple.rego](examples/01-simple.rego)

#### Simple rules part 2: Returning attributes

[examples/02-simple-attributes.rego](examples/02-simple-attributes.rego)

#### Advanced rules part 1

[examples/03-advanced.rego](examples/03-advanced.rego)

#### Advanced rules part 2: Adding compliant resource info

[examples/04-advanced-resources.rego](examples/04-advanced-resources.rego)

#### Advanced rules part 3: Correlating resources

[examples/05-advanced-primary-resource.rego](examples/05-advanced-primary-resource.rego)

#### Advanced rules part 4: Correlating resources

[examples/06-advanced-correlation.rego](examples/06-advanced-correlation.rego)

#### Advanced rules part 5: Returning attributes

[examples/07-advanced-attributes.rego](examples/07-advanced-attributes.rego)

#### Missing resources

[examples/08-missing.rego](examples/08-missing.rego)

### Reference

#### Info objects

Info objects have different fields depending in which context they occur.

`deny[info]` fields:

 -  `message`: Message string detailing the issue.  **Required.**
 -  `resource`: Resource associated with the issue.
 -  `attributes`: List of [attribute paths](#attribute-paths).
 -  `resource_type`: May be used to indicate the resource type in case of a
    missing resource.
 -  `correlation`: May be used to override the correlation the policy engine
    uses to relate issues.  Defaults to `.resource.id`.

`resources[info]` fields:

 -  `resource`: Resource associated with the issue.  **Required.**
 -  `attributes`: List of [attribute paths](#attribute-paths).
 -  `correlation`: May be used to override the correlation the policy engine
    uses to relate issues.  Defaults to `.resource.id`.

#### Attribute paths

Attribute paths are JSON arrays of strings and numbers.  They items in these
arrays correspond to indices in objects and arrays respectively.

Considering the following JSON attributes:

```json
{
  "ingress": [
    {
      "from_port": 22,
      "to_port": 22
    }
  ]
}
```

Then the `from_port` path would be `["ingress", 0, "from_port"]`.

#### snyk API

 -  `snyk.resources(resource_type)`:
    Returns an array of resources of the requested type.  Resources are objects
    that have at least the following fields:
     *  `id`: A string identifier for the object
     *  `_type`: The type of the object, which matches the `resource_type`
        passed in to `snyk.resources`
     *  `_namespace`: Together with the `id` and `_type`, this forms a unique
        identifier for the resource

## Testing rules

### Creating and using test fixtures

In order to test rules, we want to generate _fixtures_ so that we freeze in
the processed input generated by the Unified Policy Engine.  This allows us
to use standard OPA tooling.

You can generate a fixture using the `fixture` command.  For example, we can
generate a fixture for the example terraform file we are using like this:

    ./unified-policy-engine fixture examples/main.tf >examples/tests/fixture.json

Fixtures can also be generated using other applications.  The important bit is
that a fixture should provide a `mock_input` rule which represents the input to
be used for the test.

This allows us to import and use the fixture in a test:

[examples/tests/advanced-rule-test.rego](examples/tests/advanced-rule-test.rego)

Running the tests:

    ./unified-policy-engine -d examples test

We can also run using vanilla OPA.  This requires us to pass in the
[rego/](rego/) directory as well:

    opa test examples rego

### Using the REPL

Sometimes it's helpful to interactively evaluate rules in order to debug specific
portions of code. `unified-policy-engine` includes a REPL that has two modes of
operation:

* With an input
* Without an input

Running with an input is intended to be used to debug rule code with some real input.
Running without an input is intended to be used to debug tests.

Both modes of operation use the ["pure rego" version](rego/snyk.rego) of the `snyk` API
rather than the custom built-ins used by the `run` command. In practice, these should
behave the same.

#### With an input

Running the REPL with an input will setup an environment that closely matches the way
rules are evaluated by:

* Parsing the input into a `State` object
* Setting the `input` document to the state object
  * This can be useful for inspecting the input from within the REPL, but rule code must
    use functions from the snyk API like snyk.resources() to access the input, to ensure
    compatibility with the production (non-repl) engine.

##### Examples

Introspecting a multi-resource rule:

```sh
# Invoking the REPL with an IaC input
$ ./unified-policy-engine repl -d examples examples/main.tf
# Switching to the package of a multi-resource rule
> package rules.snyk_003.tf
# Evaluating the deny rule
> deny
[
  {
    "message": "Bucket names should not contain the word bucket, it's implied",
    "resource": {
      ...
    }
  },
  {
    "message": "Bucket names should not contain the word bucket, it's implied",
    "resource": {
      ...
    }
  }
]
# Evaluating parts of the rule. Both of these are defined in rules.snyk_003.tf
> has_bucket_name(buckets[0])
true
> 
```

Introspecting a single-resource rule:

```sh
# Invoking the REPL with an IaC input
$ ./unified-policy-engine repl -d examples examples/main.tf
# Switching to the package of a single-resource rule
> package rules.snyk_001.tf
# Importing the snyk library so that we can use snyk.resources()
> import data.snyk
# Evaluating snyk.resources using the resource type defined in rules.snyk_001.tf
> snyk.resources(resource_type)
[
  {
    ...
    "_type": "aws_s3_bucket",
    ...
  },
  ...
]
# Evaluating the deny rule with a specific resource
> deny with input as snyk.resources(resource_type)[0]
[
  {
    "message": "Bucket names should not contain the word bucket, it's implied"
  }
]
> 
```

#### Without an input

Running the REPL without an input is useful for debugging tests and interacting with
test fixtures.

##### Example

```sh
# Invoking the REPL with a data directory that contains both rules and tests
$ ./unified-policy-engine repl -d examples
# Switching to the package of a test. In this case, we're using the same package name
# for both the rule and the test in order to simplify the test code.
> package rules.snyk_003.tf
# Evaluating one of the tests
> test_policy
true
# Importing the fixture used in this test
> import data.examples.main
# Evaluating the deny for this rule with our test fixture
> deny with input as main.mock_input
[
  {
    "message": "Bucket names should not contain the word bucket, it's implied",
    "resource": {
      ...
    }
  },
  {
    "message": "Bucket names should not contain the word bucket, it's implied",
    "resource": {
      ...
    }
  }
]
> 
```
