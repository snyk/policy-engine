## v0.4.0 - 2022-08-01
### Added
* docs: clarify empty array result from snyk.resources
* Accumulate errors in TF loader instead of printing warnings.  They are available under `loader.Errors()`
### Changed
* Default behavior for `input_type`. After this change, policies that do not define an `input_type` rule will be evaluated for all input types.
### Fixed
* docs: update example for array result of snyk.resources() 
* sync models code and swagger
* Compatibility issues with legacy IaC rules (see #82 for more information)
* ARM parser to capture all resource attributes
* Missing severity and remediation on "missing resource" policy results
* panic from using both Terraform and policy-engine as librarires (see fugue/regula#350)
### Security
* Updated OPA to v0.43.0
