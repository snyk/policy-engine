# This example showcases the use of the `context` field in the `info` object to
# provide user-defined policy output.

# The `context` field is a dictionary of values that can be used to provide
# additional information about the policy.

# Here the context is used in single-resource policy, but it can be used
# in multi-resource policies as well.
