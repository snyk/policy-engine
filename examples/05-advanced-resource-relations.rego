# As we saw in the previous file (<05-advanced-primary-resource.rego>),
# it can be quite annoying to correlate resources with one another.

# In order to make that easier, the policy engine provides the concept of

# <../docs/design/resource-relations.md>, this example will just cover the
# actual usage.
