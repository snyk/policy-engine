          description: |
            This field is a component of uniquely identifying a resource. It will
            resolve to different values depending on the input type and environment
            provider. For example, in a runtime AWS environment, this will be the region.
            For an IaC Terraform resource, this will be the module path. Customers of the
            API can set this to something that makes sense for them and parse it back.
