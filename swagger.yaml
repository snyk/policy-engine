      description: |
        The state format contains the state of all resources from some input. This format
        is intended to be used as both an input and output for the unified policy engine.
        It is also intended to support the visualizer and other downstream artifacts.

            This field is a component of uniquely identifying a resource. It will
            resolve to different values depending on the input type and environment
            provider. For example, in a runtime AWS environment, this will be the account
            ID. In an IaC SCM environment, this could be a git branch. Since this
            concept doesn't apply in all cases, this field is optional.
